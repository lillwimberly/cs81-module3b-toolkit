I noticed each of the functions took in a number and then manipulated it to return a different value. Also I noticed how long it took to do all of these functions.
Communicating these simple functions was difficult. Making sure I thoughtfully name my input arguments in the divide function as well.
This toolkit could easily be used as a reserve of simple operation functions. So that when you are building you could easily pick from these to save you time in the future. Instead of repeatedly building them over and over again.
